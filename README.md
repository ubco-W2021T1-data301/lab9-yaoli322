## Submission Instructions

Once you are done with his lab, **you will need to submit your repository for grading on Gradescope**.

**NOTE: If you make any changes to your GitHub repository, you MUST re-submit on Gradescope to make sure we grade the latest version of your repository. You may submit on Gradescope as many times as you like.**

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:

You may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline + grace period, but you will not be able to commit after this time!

You are all done with this Lab!
